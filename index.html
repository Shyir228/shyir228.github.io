<h1>My previous experience</h1>

<p>During the last year, I have been hired for an internship at Opera Gallery </p>
<p>It is an artwork Gallery, in the Dubai International Financial Center</p>
<p>I was mainly dealing with the artwork import & export.</p>
<h2> My tasks</h2>

<p> I had to communicate with managers about the consignation of artworks and had to negociate with them.</p>

<p>Our most important targets were:</p>

<ol>
  <li> Hotels </li>
  <li>Restaurants</li>
</ol>

<h2>Personnal Opinion


  <p>I believe that was the most rewarding experience I have been through because I had the opportunity to evolve in a very cosmopolite environment with many different cultures. Furthermore the director of the gallery put a lot of trust on me giving me a lot of responsabiliteis</p>
